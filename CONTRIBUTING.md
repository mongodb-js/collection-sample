## Bugs

You can report new bugs by
[creating a new issue](http://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-collection-sample/issues).
Please include as much information as possible about your environment
("I am using node.js v 0.12.0 on OSX Mavericks").  Actual code is always
more valuable than an explanation, so please include a link to a GitHub
gist or include a snippet directly in your issue description.

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a
minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
that version should be immediately yanked and/or a new version should be
immediately released that restores compatibility.
